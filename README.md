# focopop-node

FoCo Pop! is a fictional popsicle shop located in Fort Collins, Colorado. This project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the backend, I am using Node.js
and Express to help with endpoints in different stages of the application. I am also utilizing MailChimp's API for a basic contact form submission.
